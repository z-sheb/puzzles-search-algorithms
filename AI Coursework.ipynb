    "#### The 8-Puzzle Problem Overview:\n",
    "The 8-puzzle game consists of a 3x3 grid with 9 squares and 8 numbered tiles. The game starts with the 8 numbered tiles placed in their 'Initial State'- the player shifts one tile at a time in an effort to match the tile placement to the grid's 'Goal State'.\n",
    "The game rules are as follows:\n",
    "- Goal: reach the tile configuration in the 'Goal State' from the 'Initial State' \n",
    "- Legal Actions: up, down, left, right. \n",
    "    - One tile at a time. \n",
    "    - Only tiles adjacent to the blank space in the current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "This game can be viewed as a search problem in the sense that the player is searching for a path that would lead from the 'Initial State' to the 'Goal State' by rearranging the tiles.\n",
    "- For example: The paths would be considered short if *few tiles* are moved and *few moves* are made in the process of reaching the goal state - and vice versa.\n",
    "- An example of a task that applies the same logic is mapping directions to a location (ex. GPS). \n",

    "#### A* Algorithm Overview:\n",
    "Heuristics are *informed* problem-solving techniques, meaning that they use a heuristic / estimation of the fastest path to the solution. This can provide a time-efficient solution to given problems. The solution / path is based on a simple set of rules (depending on the problem), however, using a heuristic function does not guarantee that the solution is optimal, just that it is complete.\n",
    "The A* algorithm is a computer algorithm that employs heuristic functions to find the path in a tree with the lowest cost  from the start node to the goal node. With an admissible heuristic function, A* provides a complete and optimal solution. A heuristic function is considered admissible if it uses an optimistic estimate- that is that it does not overestimate the cost. The algorithm keeps track of each node visited and doesn't waste time exploring paths with relatively higher cost. \n",
    "The A* algorithm uses the following function f(n) to calculate the cost of a move at every node:\n",
    "*f(n) = g(n) + h(n)*\n",
    "- *f(n)* = total estimated cost of path through node *n*\n",
    "- *g(n)* = sum of costs so far that made us reach node *n*\n",
    "- *h(n)* =  estimated cost from node *n* to goal node (heuristic)\n",
    "    - Can be calculated using Manhattan Distance from node *n* to the goal node. Manhattan Distance is the sum of vertical and horizontal steps / distance between two points.\n",
    "    - Ideally *h(n) = h x (n)*\n",
    "    - When *h(n)* = 0, the algorithm prioritizes finding the *shortest* path to the goal node (aka Dijkstra's algorithm)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " The goal is to choose the path with the smallest cost (*f(n)* ) possible. "

    "2. *h<sub>2</sub>(n)*: sum of Manhattan distance for every tile from current to goal state\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason these two heuristics are admissible is because they do not overestimate the cost of moves made to reach the goal state, and help us find an optimal path from the start to the goal state. They help guide the algorithm from the start state to the goal state efficiently. \n",
    "The reason H1 was chosen is because every tile in the start state is misplaced and will therefore need to be moved in order to reach the goal state. \n",
    "As for H2, it is used since with every move each tile can only get 1 step closer to the goal position. Our goal is to minimize both functions; the smaller the sum of misplaced tiles and the smaller the sum of distances, the closer we are to reaching the goal state.  "

The fringe tells us the number of possible nodes we can move to from the current state. The smaller fringe size could indicate that the tree was better at choosing next moves and eliminating incorrect states.

The solution with the least duplicates that best satisfies the constraints is selected for reproduction. The function measures the number of duplicates in each row, column, and square. Fewer duplicates = better fitness The constraints of the Sudoku puzzle are:\n",
    "    - Each *row* should not have duplicates\n",
    "    - Each *column* should not have duplicates\n",
    "    - Each *square* should not have duplicates\n",
    "    \n",
    "The simplest way to represent a fitness function for the Sudoku puzzle is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*fitness function* = $\\sum_{i=1}^{9} r_i + c_i + s_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $r_i$ = duplicate numbers in row i\n",
    "- $c_i$ = duplicate numbers in column i\n",
    "- $c_i$ = duplicate numbers in subgrid i\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in our program, we use a *linear combination of the partial costs* to create the *constraint satisfaction fitness function* used by the algorithm. This helps us ensure that the solution satisfies the requirements of the game and allows us to effectively measure its fitness. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selection:** The selection process is done using *ranking* and *tournament* operators. \n",
    "    - Ranking: ranks all the solutions in a population based on fitness (1 being the most fit, etc...)\n",
    "    - Tournament: randomly selects solutions from a population and compares their fitness. The solutions with higher fitness scores are reserved, while the solutions with lower fitness scores 'lose' the tournament and are eliminated. \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Crossover**: In 9x9 Sudoku puzzles, there are 8 possible *crossover points*. The crossover operators we used are: \n",
    "    - One-point crossover: *one* point is selected for both 'parents', and the position of the numbers in the offpspring is flipped accordingly.\n",
    "    - Uniform genes crossover: *randomly* selects 'gene' from the 'parents' for the offspring to inherit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Mutation**: We use *swap* as a mutation operator, which causes two numbers in a subgrid to swich positions. We set a small value for the mutation rate (0.01) for all population sizes, as a high value will lead to increased randomness. We also use *reset* mutation, which randomly changes one of the gene's values to a different legal value (range 1-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Termination**: The process will terminate once the constraints are satisified and the puzzle is solved. Otherwise, if the offspring shows no improvement in fitness, the puzzle is ruled to have no solution. "

    "* NOTE 2: One of the features of this algorithm is *Elitism*, which duplicates the fittest solutions to prevent them from being discarded throughout the process and ensures that they are reproducing and passing their genes on, ensuring that the children nodes are improving in fitness. "

    "The implemented genetic algorithm was able to successfully solve the Sudoku Puzzles, however, the run time was not ideal. The program was not as time-efficient as predicted. The best population size for the Sudoku puzzle would be either 100 or 10000, as they are both perfect squares. The worst population size was 10, which makes sense since 10 is a small population size, and the larger the population is, the higher the likelihood of it containig an optimal solution.\n",

    "As for further improvement, I would try to use the truncation rate as a selection method along with the ranking and tournament. The truncation rate would order solutions based on fitness score, and discard the percentage of solutions that are least fit, and keep the fittest solutions for reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible improvement would be usage of different crossover functions, such as the uniform allele crossover, which randomly changes a value contained in a 'gene'. This could help increase diversity of the solutions and possibly improve the fitness of the offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducting deeper analysis on the change in performance based on random seed, population size, tournament size, and mutation probability paramters would be extremely insightful given the time. We know that the increase of population size and tournament size would increase the number of fittest solutions selected for reproduction, however, it will reach a point where the search is less efficient due to the size of the possible solutions and the time it would take to filter through them.
